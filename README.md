![Task 2: Data Visualization and Storytelling](./heading.png)

**Dashboard 1**  
A comparative gauge visualization of MRR, surface roughness, and kerf width across three experiments.  
- MRR is highest in Experiment 3  
- Surface roughness is best (lowest) in Experiment 2  
- Kerf width is narrowest in Experiment 1

**Dashboard 2**  
Bar-style metrics for side-by-side comparison.  
- Confirms trends from Dashboard 1 with a clearer visual breakdown

**Dashboard 3**  
Radar chart showing overall experiment performance across all three metrics.  
- Highlights trade-offs and relative strengths per experiment

**Bar Chart**  
Grouped bars visualizing metric values for each experiment.  
- MRR increases from Exp 1 â†’ Exp 3  
- Surface roughness and kerf width decrease

**Line Graph**  
Line plot showing trends across experiments.  
- Inverse relationship observed: as MRR increases, Ra and kerf width decrease
